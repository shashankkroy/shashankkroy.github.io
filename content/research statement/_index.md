### My interests 
I have pursued my research work in the area of data assimilation before which I finished my M.Sc and B.Sc Honors in physics. During  my phd coursework, I had the chance to work on interesting projects starting with 
* analytical solution of Stokes's flow in spherical geometry using vector spherical harmonics.
* 1-d visco-eslastic pde modeling pattern formation in viscoelastic gels. 
* numerical solution to stochastic forced burgers equation.
* Kuramoto-sivashinsky PDE, which exhibits spatiotemporal chaos
* ensemble kalman filtering for Lorenz-96 using partial and noisy observations. 
	
I am generally fond of problems which involve applications were mathematical notions can be converted to code and understanding them through simulations is one of the goals. Other endeavours which are orthogonal my research but piqued my curiosity from time to time is participation in hackathons organised by scientific communitie where I often stumble across new problems and fascinating progress in deeplearning methods and their applications. Apart from the above, I have gained exposure in machine learning through courses. Also, understanding problems in climate system and their models interest me from the point of dynamical systems modeling, analysis and prediction purpose, a area whose importance is evergrowing apart from purely academic purposes. 


### Overview of my research
My thesis research work concentrates around data assimilation for chaotic dynamical system using EnKF (Evensen(2003)), a general sequential state estimation algorithm which computes the best estimate of the state with associated uncertainty. 
The underlying theme of my interests have been in studying filtering algorithms and their properties which can be used to diagnose and improve the same. Jointly with others, I have worked on demonstrating *numerical filter stability*, a crucial property of a filter using Sinkhorn distance, a distances between probaility distribution. In another work, I am looking at instability properties of a dynamical system such as *lyapunov vectors* which are of potential utility in improving the existing techniques in prediction and estimation of a dynamical system in general. Now I talk about them in detail the following posts below.
