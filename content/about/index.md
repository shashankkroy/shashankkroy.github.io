Greetings! I am Shashank Kumar Roy, a final year PhD research scholar at International Center for Theoretical Sciences - Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, Bangalore, India, where I also finished my Masters coursework in Physics. Before that I completed my Bachelors in Physics from Univeristy of Delhi. I started my doctoral work under Prof.[Amit Apte](https://www.iiserpune.ac.in/research/department/data-science/people/faculty/regular-faculty/amit-apte/359) in Data Assimilation and filtering algorithm, a methods of predicting chaotic dynamical systems which started with numerical weather prediction but now find wider applications in different fields. I have worked with Ensemble Kalman Filters, a class of monte-carlo kalman filter which implements approximate bayesian posterior computation from model estimates and real data sequentially over time in an online approach. Another work of mine is in Covariant Lyapunov Vectors, which are the local directions in the tangent manifold of a dynamical system describing the directions along which error grows with the rate corresponding to the lyapunov exponents in a chaotic dynamical system.    

 Besides, I am interestd in applying machine learning and deeplearninig algorithms which I have picked up during some of the courses and hackathons I was a part of. Particularly, I find problems in generative modelling and markov decision process arising in reinforcement learning fascinating.  Climate and geo-spatial data related problems which consists of some physics and statistical modelling are some of my specific interest. Python has been my go-to coding language. I like participating in team hackathons and discussing things over a capucchino. Feel free to contact me if you would like to drop a line or you have a similar idea to discuss via **e-mail** shashank.roy@icts.res.in, shashankroy1997@gmail.com or  [**linkedin**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shashankroy/)
